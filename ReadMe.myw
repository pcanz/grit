#	ReadMe

This project is for maintenance of the `grit.js` grammar parser code.


##	Developer Conventions

Command line tools are in the `bin/` directory.

Some tools may assume that the current directory is the folder containing this `Readme` file.

In particular the `bin/verify` script runs a regression test, using `test/test-all.js`.
